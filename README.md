# Create a Chatting DApp on the Polygon Blockchain

## Introducation
In this Project, i built a Decentralized chatting application on Polygon(mumbai) test-network from scratch. The DApp will allow users to connect with other people and chat with them. We will develop our smart contract using Solidity which will be deployed on polygon chain. We will have a basic, easy-to-use UI developed using ReactJS. So, let us begin!

## Prerequisites
* Metamask extension on your browser

# Steps:-
## Step-1
go to the url(https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/) then click right footer on the add to metamask option.
### other wise:-
Add the custom polygon test network through the metamask
* Network Name: ```Polygon Testnet```
* New RPC URL:```https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com```
* Chain ID:```80001```
* Currency Symbol:```MATIC```
* Block Explorer URL:```https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/```

## Step-2
* Copy the address from metamask

## Step-3
Now you and your friend login to this project you can chat through the blockchain technology by paying a small amount of MATIC token.
